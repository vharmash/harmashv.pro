# harmashv.pro

This is the repository for my personal CV site, built using Vue and Vite to be deployed on GitHub Pages.

A lot of the text was written with the help of ChatGPT - my English may be good, but its writing is next level.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur, if installed).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
pnpm lint
```
