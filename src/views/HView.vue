      <p class="py-2">Hello and welcome!</p>
      <p>
        I'm Volodymyr, your go-to IT expert with over a decade of experience under my belt. I've
        navigated the vast seas of IT industry from a tech support role to a senior product support
        engineer, always ready to conquer the next challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a web tech enthusiast, crafting custom UIs with JavaScript, processing bulk tasks with
        Python, and venturing into the fast-paced realm of Rust, WebAssembly, and AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mentorship, collaboration, and quality are close to my heart, be it in guiding my team,
        managing digital assets, or streamlining processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fluent in English and Ukrainian, I bridge cultural gaps and foster global connections. Keen
        on the latest tech trends, I'm always geared up for what's next.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm on the lookout for new opportunities to leverage my skills and learn more.
